Feels better after using,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stings little less than other Listerine variant, but has flouride in this one. Which helps in cleaning teeth and gums, also whitening them.Make sure you brush before using this for like 30 sec gargle, then spit. Don't use water again after rinsing mouth with it. Maybe after 1 hour later you can eat or drink.I normally use before going to bed. Works good for me.NOTE: Definitely gives you that after feeling in entire mouth (inner cheeks, inner lips, and whole mouth) as though you visited a dentist and had flouride and other medicinal rinsing/cleaning.", 14 April 2023,Verified Purchase

Honest Review : Premium Price for Salt water.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Listerine Total Care (Purple) most certainly tastes and acts like gargling with salt water.Would you rather pay Rs. 300+ or use a cup of water with a teaspoon of salt when both of them will give you the same outcome? Do as your pocket allows you to.This is a gimmic concept that people blindly fall for - Pushing basic & inexpensive-to-produce items that our grandparents used with a ridiculous premium charged by conglomerates in the name of modernism., 27 July 2023,Verified Purchase

Everything good except excessive dryness post use,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked the product. Best taste, no strong aftertaste like the other variants, super effective but probably due to the strong characteristics of the product it makes my mouth dry which was not a problem until I noticed my tongue turning black after 15 days of use. I asked my dentist and she told me that its due to dead skin buildup on my tongue due to excessive dryness after using this mouthwash. Stopped using it and it went back to normal within 2-3 days.", 7 March 2023,N/A
